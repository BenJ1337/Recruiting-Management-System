## Business case

The hiring process should be digitized to improve the quality of job postings, speed up feedback loops, and reduce errors â€” ultimately making the process leaner.
Currently, the process is analog and relies on paper forms, which are repeatedly passed between the hiring manager and the HR recruiter.
